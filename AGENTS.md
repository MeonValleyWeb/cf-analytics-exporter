# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/pages/` holds route-backed `.astro` or `.md` pages (file-based routing).
- `src/components/` contains reusable UI components.
- `src/layouts/` stores shared page layouts.
- `src/styles/` contains global styles and Tailwind entrypoints.
- `public/` serves static assets at the site root.
- `dist/` is build output generated by `astro build`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs dependencies.
- `npm run dev` starts the local Astro dev server at `http://localhost:4321`.
- `npm run build` produces the production SSR build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally for verification.
- `npm run astro -- --help` lists additional Astro CLI tasks.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use 2-space indentation for Astro, JS/TS, and CSS.
- Name components in `PascalCase` (e.g., `AnalyticsChart.astro`).
- Keep page filenames route-focused (e.g., `src/pages/index.astro`).
- Favor ES module syntax (`import`/`export`) to match `type: module`.
- No formatter or linter is configured; keep changes consistent with existing files.

## Testing Guidelines
- Automated tests are not currently configured.
- Validate changes by running `npm run build` and `npm run preview`.
- If adding tests in the future, document the framework and commands here.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Git history is minimal (initial commit only). Use clear, imperative messages such as `Add charts page`.
- PRs should describe the user-facing impact, note any configuration changes, and include screenshots for UI updates.
- Link related issues or tickets when available.

## Deployment Notes
- Netlify secret scanning may flag `PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` even though it is safe for client use.
- Add `PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` to Netlify’s allowed exposed secrets list to avoid blocked builds.

## Architecture & Configuration Notes
- The app uses Astro 5 with SSR output and the Netlify adapter (`@astrojs/netlify`).
- Keep deployment-related changes in `astro.config.mjs` and `netlify/` config files.
